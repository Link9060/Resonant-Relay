# Resonant-Relay

Relay is the Resonant student communication app.

The application source lives in [`relay/`](./relay). It is a static Next.js export configured for GitHub Pages at:

<https://link9060.github.io/Resonant-Relay/>

## Local development

```bash
cd relay
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Checks:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

GitHub Actions builds and deploys `relay/out` through [`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`](./.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml) when changes reach `main`.

Launch-readiness notes and manual Supabase/provider steps are documented in [`docs/launch/`](./docs/launch).


## ARROW beta review — October 6, 2026

ARROW’s shared account supports username/password registration without email or phone. Usernames use 3–20 letters, digits or underscores; new passwords require at least 12 characters. Recovery email can be linked and verified from Relay Profile → Sign-in and recovery; phone linking is offered only when SMS Auth is enabled. Existing Google and email sign-in remain available. New accounts still follow the existing beta approval policy.

The ARROW bar → Settings links to profile, notification device registration and setup, layout and particle preferences, privacy, terms, account export/deletion, and the setup guide. Appearance supports system/light/dark, reduced motion and custom accent color. Device preferences are separate from cloud account planning data.

Phone sign-in is currently blocked by `external.phone=false` in Supabase Auth. The UI detects that and explains the available alternatives. Enabling real SMS delivery requires a configured provider; code alone does not enable it.

This review also repairs shared panel Escape handling, failed task/event writes, stale panel responses, notification/help discoverability, light-theme surfaces and accent propagation. The 200 additional corrections listed in Relay’s `docs/arrow-ui-200.md` are individual small-text readability corrections, not 200 independent functionality bugs.
